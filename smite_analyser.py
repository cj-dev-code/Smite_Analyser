# Smite Data Processor.

# First Steps:
#   Get Data loaded for builds etc.
#   Get data loaded for gods and their passives (Just adc's for now lol)
#   Try to figure out a good metric to tell if someone can win a boxing match
#   Try to figure out a good metric to tell if someone can win a match.





# What I would like:
#   Just based on hitting all autos, who will win the trade?
#   Just based on hitting all abilities, who will win the trade?
#   Putting out as much damage as possible, who will win the trade?
#   - Using the 1
#   - Using the 2
#   - Using the 3
#   - Using the ult.

#  Graph of powerspike graph throughout the game.

#   Who will win this teamfight if everyone goes all in on the fight?
#      How will I measure that?

# Player_stats -> Objective Takedown Time
    # Buff Camps
    # Towers
    # Objectives
    
# Player_stats -> dps & dps'
    # dps is strick damage per second
    # dps' is a fight metric. Factors in lifesteal as well to say when combined with another player's dps' who will lose or win a fight

# Player1, Player2 -> who wins the fight?
    
    
    
    

    
# in the future, I would like to:
#   Say who theortically will win a fight of NxB players
#       Based on % dps' from the theoretical, to account for skill.
#   Say what the best farm strategy is for leveling up (beating opponents/tacking objectives faster)
#   Say what the best objective strategy is for winning the game ()
#   Say what the best teamfight strategy is for winning the game
#   Say what the best teamfight + objective strategy is for accomplishing the game
    
# How can I do any of this?
    #   I can assemble an AI to play a simplified smite game.
        # Can take objectives,
        # Add players to teamfights,
        #
